					<h2>Ilaria Del Rossia</h2>
					<p> Originally from Italy, it was while growing up among the sweet smells of Italian specialties that Chef Del Rossia decided to start cooking. Cooking has always been a great passion. As her family used to remind her, using fresh products is essential to bring out the flavours! She is therefore particularly attached to the quality of the raw materials, their origin, but also to the way of working them, the dressing and the final presentation. Ilaria is particularly attached to her region and will not fail to make you discover an explosion of southern flavours. </p>
